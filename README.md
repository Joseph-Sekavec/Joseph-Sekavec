- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joseph-Sekavec
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, ethical hacking, computer architecture, web development, creating scripts to automate tasks, and programming languages/paradigmns.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning The basics of Java and Python, and I am trying to learn more about the c++ stl as I have learned a lot of the basics in cs so far, and as such there
are some holes in my knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  Some really basic projects that can lead to more interesting projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: My linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-sekavec-8500a7a7/ (This link should work).
